My first Flask project - learning full-stack in Python as part of my Software Workshop module in my Year in Computer Science.

Goals for the project:
- Explore the different types of components, e.g. carousels, dropdowns, embedded videos/audio/gifs
- Learn more about different form elements and how they are used
- Learn how to use APIs and other utilities to widen the scope of functionality I can implement
alongside working through the module content of course!
